# Knight's Tour Problem Solver

This Java program solves the Knight's Tour problem using Depth-First Search (DFS) and Greedy algorithms.

## Problem Description

The Knight's Tour problem involves moving a knight on an 8x8 chessboard to every square exactly once. The knight follows the rules of chess movement, moving in an L-shape.

## Algorithms Used

### Depth-First Search (DFS)

The Depth-First Search algorithm is used to explore all possible paths by moving the knight to adjacent unvisited squares recursively until a solution is found or all paths are explored.

### Greedy Algorithm

The Greedy algorithm selects the next move based on the heuristic that chooses the square with the fewest available moves from it.
